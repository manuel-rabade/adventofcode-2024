| Day      | P1             | P2             | Feeling            | Remarks |
|:--------:|:--------------:|:--------------:|:------------------:|:--------|
| [1](01)  | :green_circle: | :green_circle: | :ok_hand:          | Iterated through all elements to calculate distances and similarities. A perfect warm-up exercise. |
| [2](02)  | :green_circle: | :green_circle: | :shrug:            | Part 1 was straightforward. For part 2, being clever in `refactor.py` never worked; `brute_force.py` did. |
| [3](03)  | :green_circle: | :green_circle: | :relaxed:          | Regex made the day. |
| [4](04)  | :green_circle: | :green_circle: | :upside_down_face: | Part 1's approach seemed easy but was deceptively tricky. Refactoring in part 2 made it straightforward. |
| [5](05)  | :green_circle: | :green_circle: | :smile:            | Key was to build a rules dict. Easy peasy. |
| [6](06)  | :green_circle: | :red_circle:   | :dizzy_face:	  | Part 1 was easy; brute force in part 2 doesn’t work because it hangs in some cases. |
| [7](07)  | :green_circle: | :green_circle: | :thumbsup:         | Recursion was the hero. A small optimization for part 2 nearly halved the execution time. |
| [8](08)  | :green_circle: | :green_circle: | :hand_over_mouth:  | The solution came out very C-like, but it was great to get back on track. |
| [9](09)  | :green_circle: | :green_circle: | :wink:             | Tried to be clever with the programming, but a simpler approach worked better. Focus on the data issues first, then the programming. |
| [10](10) | :green_circle: | :green_circle: | :bowtie:           | Solved quickly using recursion and a dictionary with tuples as keys. Elegant and efficient. |
| [11](11) | :green_circle: | :red_circle:   | :exploding_head:   | Part 1 was easy but a trap. For Part 2, optimizing speed exhausted memory, while optimizing memory drastically slowed runtime. |
| [12](12) | :green_circle: | :red_circle:   | :weary:            | Thought both parts would be fine, but Part 2 fails. Sample results are correct, but the problem input gives the wrong result, and I can’t find the bug. |
| [13](13) | :green_circle: | :green_circle: | :nerd_face:        | Part 1 brute force did the trick. For Part 2, good ol' math saved the day. Lucky 13, feels great to be back on track after two unfinished days. |
| [14](14) | :green_circle: | :green_circle: | :blush:            | Part 2 was intriguing and exciting: searching for the tree tip over 10k seconds narrowed the possible answers to 48, which I manually analyzed to find the tree. |
| [15](15) | :green_circle: | :green_circle: | :grin:             | Part 1 was a good warm-up for Part 2, which, although tricky, I solved using the same algorithm plus some recursion. |
